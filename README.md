🧠 3D MRI Reconstruction using Multicoil Raw Data

This repository contains research work focused on 3D MRI reconstruction from multicoil raw k-space data, leveraging modern signal processing and machine learning techniques.
The project aims to explore efficient reconstruction methods under low-data and accelerated MRI settings, with emphasis on robustness and reconstruction quality.

📌 Project Overview

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction from raw k-space data is a critical problem in medical imaging. Multicoil MRI improves signal quality but increases reconstruction complexity.
This project investigates reconstruction pipelines using anonymized 3D multicoil MRI scans, targeting:

Improved reconstruction quality

Noise reduction and artifact suppression

Efficient learning from limited or undersampled data

The work is intended for research and experimental purposes.
